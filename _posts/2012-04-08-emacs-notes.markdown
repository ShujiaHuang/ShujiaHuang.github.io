* Remove trailing whitespace

    1. Enter PictureMide - `M-x picture-mode`
    2. Exit picture mode - `C-c C-c`

The only side effect of this is that all trailing whitespace is removed.

     1. When doing iseach. `C-w` adds the word folling point to the search buffer,
        Very useful, `C-y` adds the reset of current line to the search buffer
     2.
